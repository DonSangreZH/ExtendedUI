## What Sorcery Is This?

ExtendedUI, as the name suggest, extends Tree of Savior's UI to what it should be!

## Issues

In the current release there are following issues:
- Higher/Lower than 1920x1080 resolutions break the sysmenu (Still investigating)
- Pressing the `Show Frame Area` button multiple times throws an error and breaks the menu (Fixed in next release)
- Child frames currently don't get saved on the first run, for now please restart the client at least once before using. (Still investigating)
- Restoring Defaults breaks under certain conditions

Please send me a private message in-game (Server: Klaipeda) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0yyOKTr8o3OdJTxa) and message me `privately` on there. Alternatively, please open up a [issue](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/issues).

## Installation

###~~ DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE DIRECTLY OFF THE REPOSITORY IT WILL NOT WORK ~~
###~~ THIS ADDON HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED WITH 1920x1080 RESOLUTION ANYTHING HIGHER OR LOWER MIGHT, AND CURRENTLY DOES BREAK IT ~~

ExtendedUI requires [cwAPI](https://github.com/fiote/treeofsavior-addons) from [fiote](https://github.com/fiote/) to work!

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/releases) and download the package that suits you best.

Extract the package into your '\Steam\SteamApps\common\TreeOfSavior\' folder.

After extracting make sure 'extendedui.ipf' in your data folder has a '⚗' in front of it.

If it does not don't forget to add it so it looks like '⚗extendedui.ipf' otherwise it will not work!

## Usage
### DON'T FORGET TO PRESS 'SAVE' AFTER YOU'RE DONE OR YOUR SETTINGS WILL BE DISCARDED
After installing ExtendedUI you're ready to use it!
Go into your Game Settings and press the big friendly ExtendedUI button!

Click on the Frames tab to continue!

Once in the Frames tab, clicking on Show Frame Area at the top will show every frame and make them draggable.

Alternatively, you can show each frame individually and drag them around this way, or use the sliders.
