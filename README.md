## What Sorcery Is This?

ExtendedUI allows you to move most UI elements on your screen to wherever you want them.  
It also comes with a few nice options to customize your UI even further, including:
- Showing exact experience numbers when hovering over your experience bars
- Disabling recipe item popups
- Some elements save their hidden status, like FPS
- And many more

## Issues

Please send me a private message in-game (Server: Klaipeda, Family Name: Belhi) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0yyOKTr8o3OdJTxa) and message me `privately` on there. Alternatively, please open up a [issue](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/issues).

## Installation

___DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE DIRECTLY OFF THE REPOSITORY IT WILL NOT WORK___

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/releases/latest) and download the latest version.
2. Extract the package into your '\Steam\SteamApps\common\TreeOfSavior\' folder.
3. After extracting make sure 'extendedui.ipf' in your data folder has a '⚗' in front of it.  
  If it does not, don't forget to add it so it looks like '⚗extendedui.ipf' otherwise it will not work!

It is not recommended to download the ipf file manually.

Alternatively, use the fancy new [Addon Manager](https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Addon-Manager/releases)!

## Usage

After installing ExtendedUI you're ready to use it!
Go into your **Game Settings** and press the big friendly ExtendedUI button!
