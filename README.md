## What Sorcery Is This?

ExtendedUI allows you to move most UI elements on your screen to wherever you want them.  
It also comes with a few nice options to customize your UI even further, including:
- Showing exact experience numbers when hovering over your experience bars
- Disabling recipe item popups
- Some elements save their hidden status, like FPS
- And many more planned in the future

## Issues

In the current release there are following issues:
- Sliders stop working, just reopen the menu to fix (Still Investigating)

Please send me a private message in-game (Server: Klaipeda, Family Name: Belhi) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0yyOKTr8o3OdJTxa) and message me `privately` on there. Alternatively, please open up a [issue](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/issues).

## Installation

###~~ DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE DIRECTLY OFF THE REPOSITORY IT WILL NOT WORK ~~

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MizukiBelhi/ExtendedUI/releases/latest) and download the latest version.

Extract the package into your '\Steam\SteamApps\common\TreeOfSavior\' folder.

After extracting make sure 'extendedui.ipf' in your data folder has a '⚗' in front of it.

If it does not don't forget to add it so it looks like '⚗extendedui.ipf' otherwise it will not work!

## Usage
### DON'T FORGET TO PRESS 'SAVE' AFTER YOU'RE DONE OR YOUR SETTINGS WILL BE DISCARDED
After installing ExtendedUI you're ready to use it!
Go into your Game Settings and press the big friendly ExtendedUI button!

Once in the Frames tab, clicking on Show Frame Area at the top will show every frame and make them draggable.

Alternatively, you can show each frame individually and drag them around this way, or use the sliders.
